# My malloc

- In this project, I create the malloc function, including first-fit malloc and best-fit malloc. The source code stores in the my_malloc.c.
- The folder alloc_policy_tests, alloc_policy_tests_osx and general_tests contains some method to test the malloc, please have a try if you want.

Thanks for your time and attention.
